I have made this application to learn Firebase and Navigation Companent better.

<h1>Libraries Used</h1>

[ViewBinding][1] : View binding is a feature that makes it easier to write code that interacts with views

[Navigation Companent][2] : Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app

[Firebase Authentication][3] : Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app

[Firebase Storage][4] : Cloud Storage for Firebase lets you upload and share user generated content, such as images and video, which allows you to build rich media content into your apps

[Firebase Firestore][5] : Firebase offers two cloud-based, client-accessible database solutions that support realtime data syncing: Cloud Firestore is Firebase's newest database for mobile app development

[Picasso][6] : A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android.
